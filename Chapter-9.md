## Energy and Light
    - Chemical energy & ATP
        - Energy comes in many forms ( chemical, light, heat, electrical ..)
        - Energy stored in Chemical form is used in Homeostasis for cell growth, movement of cell material.
        - All living cells store energy in Chemical bonds, the source of these energy can be from sunlight or from
          food.

    - Storing energy
        - All living cells get their energy from chemical bonds of certain compounds
        - One of the most important compound is ATP. (Adenosine Triphosphate)
            - ATP consists of a 5 carbon sugar called ribose,and three phosphate groups.
            - those phosphate groups are the key to ATPs ability to store and release energy.
            - ADP(Adenosine diphosphate) is a similar compound, but only contains 2 phosphate groups
            - ATP can release and store energy by breaking down and reforming the bonds between its phosphate
              groups. This characteristic of ATP makes it exceptionally useful as a basic energy source for all cells

    - How cells use ATP
        - Cells use a considerable amount of their energy on protein pumps(On cell membrane)
            - Pumps Sodium ions(Na+) out of the cell & potassium ions(K+) into the cell.
        -  Chemical energy from ATP can be converted into light energy(Fireflies)
        - cells store only a tiny amount of ATP
            - Since glucose can store 90x more energy than it takes to add a phosphate group to ADP, it is preffered
              to store energy over ATP. And sugar is used to regenerate ATP to ATP.

    - Heterotrophs & Autotrophs
        - Heterotrophs get food from external sources
        - Autotrophs make their own food(Photosynthesis)

## Photosynthesis: An Overview

    - Chlorophyll & Chloroplasts
        - Photosynthesic organisms use pigments to capture the energy in sunlight
            - Chlorophyll doesnt not absorb green light giving the leaves a green color
            - Carotene absorbs orange and red, these pigments show in autumn when the chlorophyll molecules break
              down

        - Chloroplasts
            - in the chloroplasts there are saclike chrolophyll containing membranes called thylakoids
                - They are where light dependant reactions takes place.(Adds a third phosphate to ADP to make ATP)
                - They are stacked up and arranged in granas
            - the fliud portion outside thethylakoids are called stroma

        - High-Energy Electrons
            -  An electron carrier is a compound that can accept a pair of high electron and transfer them along
               with most of their energy, to other molecules.
                - NADP+ is a carrier molecule. (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate)
                - it holds 2 high energy electrons

        - Photosynthesis
                          light
            - 6CO2 + 6H2O  -->  C6H12O6 + 6O2

            - The ATP and NADPH produced in light dependant reaction are used in light independent reaction to build
            sugars from CO2. (Calvin Cycle)

## The Process of Photosynthesis


    - Light dependant reactions: Generating ATP and NADPH
        - THe light dependant reaction uses energy from sunlight to convert ADP & NADP+ into the energy and
          electron carriers ATP & NADPH. These reactions also produces O2.

    - Photosystems
        - Clusters of chlorophyll and proteins inside the thylakoid.
        - They are surrounded by accessory pigments.
        - essential to light dependant reactions.

    **Photosystems --> Light --> High Energy Electrons --> passed to electron carriers embeddeb im membranes.**

    - Photosystem II
        - PS II is responsible for the light-dependent oxidation of water (H2O) to produce oxygen (O2), protons (H+),
          and electrons.
        - The electrons from PS II are transferred to the electron transport chain.(ETC)
            - ETC : A series of electron carrier proteins hat shuttle high energy electrons during ATP generation.
            - The thylakoid membrane provides new electrons to chlorophyll to replace the lost ones.
                - these electrons come from H2O.
                - enzymes in the innersurface of the thylakoid split the H2O into 2 protons(H+) & 2 electrons(e-)&
                  one oxygen.
                - e- move outside of the membrane, And positive H+ is realeased inside.(Charge seperation across
                    membrane)
                - These e- are replaces to chlorophyll which lost electrong to ETC. leaving out oxygen as a gas.

        -ETC
            - Enegry from the electrons are used by protiens in the chain to pump more H+ ions from the stroma inside
               the thylakoid sac
            - At the end of the chain electrons are passed to PS I
            - The energy from the electrons is used to pump protons (H+) across the thylakoid membrane, creating a
              proton gradient.

        - PS I
            - part of the electrons energy in used to pump the H+ ions, across the thyalakoid membrane resulting
              in lower energy electrons.
            - pigments in PS I use light energy to reenrgyize the electrons and pass them out to another ETC and
              eventually to NADP+ in the stroma.
            - At the end of the short 2nd ETC, NADP+ picks up high energy electrons along with H+ ions, at the outer
              surface of the thylakoid membrane to become NADPH.(Reduction)
                - NADPH is use in light independant reactions

        - H+ ions Movement and ATP Formation
          - As the thylakoid space fills up with +ve charged H+ ions, the inside of the thylakoid membrane
            becomes positively charged relative to the outside of the membrane.
          - H+ ions pass back across the thylakoid membrane through ATP syntase into the stroma.
          - As the ions pass through the ATP synthase molecule rotates and the energy produced is used to convert
            ADP to ATP.(Reduction)
              - ATP is used in light independant reaction.


        - Photosynthesis uses light energy , H2O to produce O2 and convert (ADP,NADP+) to energy carriers(ATP,NADPH)
        - ATP and NADPH are needed to build high-energy SUgards from low-energy CO2.

          PSII --> ETC --> PSI --> ETC --> ATP synthase --> ATP(Reduction)
                                    |
                                    `--> NADPH(Reduction)


        - Light dependant reaction Steps:
            1. Photo-Excitation
            2. ETC
            3. Photolysis

            4. chemiosmosis
            5. Reduction (ADP -> ATP)
            6. Second ETC
            7. Reduction ( NADPH  )


### Light Dependent Reaction:


    - Calvin Cycle
        -


----------------
Photosystem II (PSII) precedes Photosystem I (PSI) in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis because of the
way the two photosystems are connected and the direction of electron flow.

Here's a brief overview:

1. **Light absorption**: Light is absorbed by pigments (such as chlorophyll a) in the thylakoid membrane of the
chloroplast.
2. **Excitation of electrons**: The absorbed light energy excites electrons, which are then transferred to a special
molecule called an electron acceptor.
3. **Electron transport chain**: The electrons are passed along a series of electron carriers in the thylakoid
membrane, known as the electron transport chain.

Now, here's where the order of PSII and PSI comes in:

**Photosystem II (PSII)**:

* PSII is responsible for the light-dependent oxidation of water (H2O) to produce oxygen (O2), protons (H+), and
electrons.
* The electrons from PSII are passed to a molecule called pheophytin, which then transfers them to the electron
transport chain.
* The energy from the electrons is used to pump protons (H+) across the thylakoid membrane, creating a proton
gradient.

**Photosystem I (PSI)**:

* PSI is responsible for the light-dependent reduction of NADP+ to form NADPH.
* The electrons from the electron transport chain are passed to PSI, where they are used to reduce NADP+ to form
NADPH.
* The energy from the electrons is also used to generate ATP from ADP and Pi (phosphate) through the process of
chemiosmosis.

The reason PSII precedes PSI is that the electrons from PSII need to be passed to the electron transport chain, which
then generates the proton gradient that drives the synthesis of ATP. The electrons from the electron transport chain
are then passed to PSI, where they are used to reduce NADP+ to form NADPH.

In other words, the energy from light is first used to generate a proton gradient (PSII), which is then used to
produce ATP and NADPH (PSI). This order makes sense because the energy from light is first used to generate the
energy-rich molecules (ATP and NADPH) that are needed for the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) to occur.

-------------------

The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, also known as the Hill reaction or light-harvesting reactions, are
the first stage of photosynthesis. They occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast and are responsible for
converting light energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH.

**Overview of the Light-Dependent Reactions**

The light-dependent reactions involve the absorption of light energy by pigments such as chlorophyll a and other
accessory pigments in the thylakoid membrane. This energy is then used to drive a series of electron transfer
reactions, which ultimately result in the formation of ATP and NADPH.

**Step-by-Step Explanation of the Light-Dependent Reactions**

1. **Light Absorption**: Light is absorbed by pigments such as chlorophyll a and other accessory pigments in the
thylakoid membrane.
2. **Excitation of Electrons**: The absorbed light energy excites electrons, which are then transferred to a special
molecule called an electron acceptor.
3. **Electron Transfer**: The electrons are passed along a series of electron carriers in the thylakoid membrane,
known as the electron transport chain.
4. **Proton Pumping**: As the electrons are transferred, protons (H+) are pumped across the thylakoid membrane,
creating a proton gradient.
5. **ATP Synthesis**: The energy from the proton gradient is used to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi
(phosphate) through the process of chemiosmosis.
6. **NADPH Formation**: The electrons ultimately reduce NADP+ to form NADPH.

**Key Players in the Light-Dependent Reactions**

1. **Photosystem II (PSII)**: PSII is responsible for the light-dependent oxidation of water (H2O) to produce oxygen
(O2), protons (H+), and electrons.
2. **Photosystem I (PSI)**: PSI is responsible for the light-dependent reduction of NADP+ to form NADPH.
3. **Cytochrome b6f Complex**: This complex is an electron carrier that helps to transfer electrons from PSII to PSI.
4. **Plastocyanin**: This protein is an electron carrier that helps to transfer electrons from the cytochrome b6f
complex to PSI.

**Equation for the Light-Dependent Reactions**

2H2O + light energy → 2ATP + 2NADPH + O2 + 2H+

**Importance of the Light-Dependent Reactions**

The light-dependent reactions are essential for the production of ATP and NADPH, which are used in the
light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) to synthesize glucose from CO2.
