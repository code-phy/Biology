# Cellular Respiration:

- Chemical Energy and Food:
    - Food molecules contain chemical energy which gets released when their bonds are broken
    - Organisms get energy from food
    - Energy stored in food is measured in calories
    - Calorie = 1gram of water --> 1 degree celcius
        - 1 gram of sugar/protein = 3811 calories
        - 1 gram of fat = 8893 calories
        - 1000 calories = 1 kilocalorie(Calories)

- Cellular Respiration
    - Cells can obtain energy from food in pressence of oxygen.(Cellular Respiration)
    - 602 + C6H12O6 --> 6CO2 + 6H2O + Energy
    - Cells control the storage of energy from the food molecules(ATP)
    - Stages of Cellular Respiration ( stages for food to energy )
        1. Glycolosis(Anaerobic):
            - Happens in Cytoplasm
            - 10% of energy is captured to produce ATP remaining 90% is in Pyruvic acid.
        2. Krebs Cycle(Citric Acid Cycle)(Aerobic) ( Inside mitocondira )
            - a little more energy is captured from pyruvic acid.
        3. Electron transport(Oxidative phosphorylation)(Aerobic) ( Inside mitocondria )
            - Builk of energy is released using the reactants from above two steps.
            - Energy is released using Oxygen as electron acceptor.

    - Oxygen and Energy:
        - O2 is required at the end of Electron transport.
        - Cellular Respiration requires O2 to release energy (Aerobic)
        - Krebs cycle, Electron transport = Aerobic processes.
        - Kerb cycle does not directly require O2 but called Aerobic as it can not run without Electron transport.
           Electron transport depends on oxygen.
        - Glycolosis is anaerobic
        - in the absense of oxygen the cell uses fermentation.(Anaerobic)

    - Glycolosis :
        - Means sugar breaking.
        - 1 Glucose --> 2 Pyruvic Acid
        - ATP Production:
            - Glycolosis requires 2 ATP molecules to start the process.
            - At the end of Glycolosis, it produces 4 ATP molecules ( a net gain of 2 ATP )
        - NADH Production:
            - One reaction of glycolosis removes 4 electrons and passes these high energy electrons
               to an electron carrier NAD+(Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide)
            - NAD+ accepts a pair of high enenrgy electrons and a hydrogen ion to form NADH.
               NAD+ + e- + H --> NADH
        - In glycolosis 4 ATP molecules are produced and synthesized from 2 ADP molecules.
        - Glycolosis process is fast and produces thousands of ATP molecules in milliseconds.

    - Krebs Cycle(Citric Acid Cycle):
        - Pyruvic acid is broken down into CO2 in a series of energy extraction reactions.
        - Pyruvic acid -> enters through 2 mitocondira membranes into matrix(innermost compartment of mitochondria)
                        2 pyruvic acid (3 carbons)-> Acetyl-CoA ( 4 carbons ) + CO2  (NAD+ -> NADH to electron chain)
          --> Acetyl CoA enters into cycle and combines with 4 carbon molucule in the cycle and creates citric acid
          --> Citric acid is then converted into a 5 carbon compound and turns NAD+ to NADH(To ETC)
          --> 5 carbon then releases another CO2 and becomes a 4 carbon compound and turns NAD+ into NADH
          --> Releases energy (ADP to ATP)
          --> Turns FAD (Flavine Adenine Dinucleotide) into FADH2 and turns NAD+ into NADH
          --> 4 carbon restarts the cycle
        - Energy extraction
            - At 5 places in each cycle electron carrier accepts a pair of hydrogen ions and high energy electron
               Changing NAD+ to NADH , FAD to FADH2
            - The ATP molecules become available to power cell activities
            - As for carrier molecules like NADH in presense of o2 the electrons they hold are used to generate huge
               amounts of ATP
    - Electron Transport(Oxidative Phosphorylation):
        - Uses high energy electrons from gylcolosys and the krebs cycle to systhesize ATP from ADP.
        - High energy electrons are passed from NADH and FADH2 into the ETC
        - In eukaryotes, the ETC is composed of a series of electron carriers & is located in the inner membrane of
           the michondria.
        - In prokaryotes the same chain is in the cell membrane
        - at the end of the ETC an enzyme combines the high energy electrons wit a H+ and Oxygen to form water.
        - Oxygen is the final electron acceptor of the chain, that is why electron transport is Aerobic.
        - For every 2 high energy electrons passed down the ETC thir energy is used to transport H+ across the
           membrane, making the membrane positively charged(w.r.t Matrix)(Membrane acts like a battery)
        - ATP Production
            - Cells use a process called chemiosmisis
                - High elergy electrons create a gradient and forces the H+ ions to go through the channel in these
                    enzymes causing the ATP syntase to spin.
                - For every rotation, ATP synthase grabs a molecule of ADP & combines it with a phosphate group to
                    produce ATP
                - Similar to light dependant reactions in photosynthesis
                - each pair of high energy electrons produce 3 ATP molecules while it covers the full length of ETC.
        - Totals
            - On an average, for every molecule of glucose, cellular respiration produces 36 molucules of ATP
            - More efficient than a car burning gasoline
            - 36% of total energy from a molecule of glucose is produced
            - the other 64% is released in heat energy.

- Fermentation
    - When the body doesnt have oxygen to continue the aerobic reactions it uses fermentation to produce ATP.
        - Happens in cytoplasm of the cell
        - Basically glycolosis + Restoration of NAD+
        - converts NADH to NAD+ by passing the electron back to pyruvic acid.(Allowing glycolosis to continue)
        - There are 2 types
            - Alchoholic fermentation
                - Products are CO2 and ethyl alchohol
                - Pyruvic Acid + NADH --> Alchohol + CO2 + NAD+
                - Yeast, Beers, etc.
            - Lactic Acid fermentation
               - Products are Lactic Acid
               - Pyruvic Acid + NADH --> Lactic acid + NAD+
               - buttermilk, kimchi, pickles, etc.
    - For exercises that are more than 90 second then cellular respiration is needed to continue ATP Production.
