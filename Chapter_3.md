# Introduction to global systems

### Ecology
   - The study of interactions among organisms, communities, populations and with their environment

### Biosphere
   - The part of the earth that supports life.

### Levels of organization

   **Species**
      - individuals that can breed with one another and produce fertile offspring.
   **Population**
      - all the individuals of the same species (ducks) in an area
   **Community**
      - all the different species in an area (ducks + maple trees + dragonflies)
   **Ecosystem**
      - the community plus the physical factors in an area (ducks + maple trees + dragonflies + temperature + soil+ rainfall)
   **Biome**
      - large area that has a particular climate, and particular species of plants and animals that live there

Ecologists gather data by observing, experimenting and Modeling

### Biotic factors
    - Any living part in an ecosystem with which an organism might interact. 

### Abiotic factors
   - Any nonliving part in an ecosystem, ex: sunlight, heat, precipitation, humidity, wind,water currents
     and soil types.

### Global systems
   - Hydroshpere
   - Atmosphere
   - Biosphere
   - Geosphere
   - All the Global system interact with each other.

# Climate, Weather, and Life

## 1. Climate and Weather
- **Weather**: Short-term changes in temperature, precipitation, clouds, and wind.
- **Climate**: Long-term patterns of temperature and precipitation.

## 2. Factors Affecting Climate
### Solar Energy
- Drives Earth’s weather systems.
- Unequal sunlight distribution causes climate variations.
- **Greenhouse Effect**: Greenhouse gases (CO₂, CH₄, H₂O vapor) trap heat, maintaining Earth's temperature.

### Latitude
- Differences in sunlight intensity create three zones:
  1. **Tropical**: Direct sunlight year-round.
  2. **Temperate**: Seasonal variations.
  3. **Polar**: Low-angle sunlight, consistently cold.

### Heat Transport
- **Wind**: Moves heat from equator to poles.
- **Ocean Currents**: Distribute heat globally, influenced by wind and Earth's rotation.

# Major Types of Biomes

1. **Terrestrial Biomes**
   - Found on land and influenced by temperature and precipitation.

   **a. Tundra**
   - Location: Arctic regions, high mountain tops.
   - Climate: Cold, dry, permafrost (frozen soil).
   - Flora: Mosses, lichens, low shrubs.
   - Fauna: Caribou, Arctic foxes, polar bears.

   **b. Taiga (Boreal Forest)**
   - Location: Northern latitudes, just south of tundra.
   - Climate: Cold winters, mild summers, moderate precipitation.
   - Flora: Coniferous trees (pine, spruce).
   - Fauna: Moose, wolves, bears.

   **c. Temperate Forest**
   - Location: Eastern US, Europe, parts of Asia.
   - Climate: Four seasons, moderate rainfall.
   - Flora: Deciduous trees (oak, maple), some conifers.
   - Fauna: Deer, squirrels, birds.

   **d. Grasslands (Savannas and Prairies)**
   - Location: Central US, Africa, parts of Asia and South America.
   - Climate: Moderate rainfall, periodic droughts.
   - Flora: Grasses, few trees.
   - Fauna: Bison, zebras, lions.

   **e. Desert**
   - Location: Africa (Sahara), Southwest US, Middle East.
   - Climate: Very dry, extreme temperatures.
   - Flora: Cacti, succulents.
   - Fauna: Lizards, snakes, camels.

   **f. Tropical Rainforest**
   - Location: Equatorial regions (Amazon, Congo).
   - Climate: Warm and wet year-round.
   - Flora: Dense, diverse vegetation (trees, vines).
   - Fauna: Monkeys, jaguars, colorful birds.

2. **Aquatic Biomes**
   - Found in water and categorized by salinity and water depth.

   **a. Freshwater Biomes**
   - Rivers, lakes, ponds, streams.
   - Flora: Algae, aquatic plants (water lilies).
   - Fauna: Fish (trout), amphibians, insects.

   **b. Marine Biomes**
   - Oceans, coral reefs, estuaries.
   - Flora: Phytoplankton, seaweed.
   - Fauna: Whales, sharks, coral, crabs.

   **c. Wetlands**
   - Mix of land and water, like swamps and marshes.
   - Flora: Mangroves, reeds.
   - Fauna: Amphibians, waterfowl, reptiles.

   **d. Estuaries**
   - Where freshwater meets saltwater.
   - Highly productive ecosystem.
   - Fauna: Crustaceans, fish, birds.


#### Factors Influencing Biomes
1. **Climate**
   - Temperature and precipitation are primary drivers.
2. **Geography**
   - Altitude, latitude, and proximity to water influence biome type.
3. **Soil Type**
   - Determines plant growth and supports specific ecosystems.
