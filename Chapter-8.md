# Chapter 8: Cell Structure and Function:

## Life is Cellular:

    - Main points of cell theory:
        * All living things are made of cells, i.e cells are the basis of all life on earth.
        * Cells are the basic unit that provides the structure and funtions of living things.
        * All cells come from pre-existing cells( new cells are produced from existing cells ).

    - Key people for the above conclusions and providing a understanding of life:
        * Robert Hooke:
            Used Microscope to study wine corks and 1st person to view a cell and name it as CELL.
        * Anton Van leeuwenhoek:
            Using single lense microscope saw cells in Pond and was first record the cells shape these cells are
            later classified as prokaryotic cells(bacteria cells).
        * Matthias Schleiden:
            Concluded that all plants are made of cells.
        * Theodor Schwann:
            Concluded/Stated that all animals are made of cells.
        * Rudolf virchow:
            Came up with the idea that new cells can be produced by cell division, and came up with "Cell Theory".

    - Microscopes:
        * Microscopes are devices for producing magnifying images, using beams of light or electrons.
        * Light Microscopes: (Compound Microscope)
            - Uses 2 lenses to magnify an Image by allowing Light to passed through the specimen.
            - First lense that is close to the specimen is called Objective lens. It magnifies the image.
            - The second lens that is close to the eye for viewing is called Ocular lens.
                This lens magnifies the image formed by the Objective lens further. Producing a enlarged image of
                the specimen.
            - Since light diffracts/scatters as they pass through matter,light microscopes can only produce clear
               images up to a magnification of 1000x.
        * Electron Microscope:
            - Electron microcscopes use a beam of electrons controlled by magnetic fields to produce magnified
               images.
            - electron microcscopes produce higher resolution images
                - 1 billionth of a meter(1-10 nanometer)
            - Dont need to be stained with chemical dyes(Uses computer to add "False colors")
            - There are two types of electron microcscopes
                - Transmission Electron Microscope:
                    - Specimens needs to be cut into very thin slices, since the electrons can only pass through
                    thin samples
                    - Images are 2D
                    - used for exploring cell sturcture and large protien molecules
                - Scanning electron microscope:
                    - A pencil like beam electrons are scanned acrosss the surface of the specimens
                    - 3D images
                    - only able to see the surface of the specimen.(Doesn't require thin slices.)

    - Prokaryotic and eukaryotic:
        * Typical cells are 5 - 50 micrometers
            - Smallest cell is 0.2 micrometers(Mycoplasma Bacteria)
            - largest cell is 1 millimeter long(Chaos Chaos ameoba)
        * All cells have a cell membrane and DNA

        * Cells fall into 2 broad categories. Nucleus(Eukaryotic) and Non-nucleus(Prokaryotic)
            - Prokaryotic cell:
                - Doesn't have nucleus

Diffraction of light and light wavelength play a crucial role in determining the clarity of images produced by
microscopes.

**Diffraction of Light:**

Diffraction is the bending of light around obstacles or the spreading of light as it passes through a narrow opening.
In the context of microscopy, diffraction occurs when light passes through the microscope's aperture (the opening
that controls the amount of light that enters the microscope). The aperture acts as a barrier, causing the light to
bend and spread out, which affects the resolution of the image.

**Light Wavelength:**

The wavelength of light is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs of a light wave. Different
wavelengths of light correspond to different colors. In microscopy, the wavelength of light used to illuminate the
sample affects the resolution of the image. Generally, shorter wavelengths (such as blue or violet light) produce
higher resolution images than longer wavelengths (such as red light).

**Relationship between Diffraction, Wavelength, and Image Clarity:**

The combination of diffraction and wavelength affects the clarity of images produced by microscopes. Here's how:

1. **Diffraction limit:** The diffraction limit is the minimum distance between two points that can be resolved as
separate entities. The diffraction limit is directly proportional to the wavelength of light used and inversely
proportional to the numerical aperture (NA) of the microscope. A higher NA and shorter wavelength result in a smaller
diffraction limit, allowing for higher resolution images.
2. **Resolution:** Resolution is the ability of a microscope to distinguish between two closely spaced points. The
resolution of a microscope is limited by the diffraction limit. A higher resolution means that the microscope can
distinguish between smaller features.
3. **Image clarity:** Image clarity is affected by the resolution and the amount of diffraction that occurs. A higher
resolution and reduced diffraction result in a clearer image.

**Microscope Types and Wavelengths:**

Different types of microscopes use different wavelengths of light to produce images:

1. **Light Microscopes:** Use visible light (400-700 nanometers) to produce images. The resolution is limited by the
diffraction limit, which is typically around 200-300 nanometers.
2. **Fluorescence Microscopes:** Use shorter wavelengths (such as UV or blue light) to excite fluorescent dyes, which
emit longer wavelengths (such as green or red light). This allows for higher resolution images.
3. **Electron Microscopes:** Use a beam of electrons (which have a much shorter wavelength than visible light) to
produce images. The resolution is much higher than light microscopes, typically in the range of 1-10 nanometers.

**Improving Image Clarity:**

To improve image clarity in microscopes, researchers use various techniques to reduce diffraction and increase
resolution:

1. **Increasing NA:** Using a higher NA objective lens can reduce the diffraction limit and improve resolution.
2. **Using shorter wavelengths:** Switching to shorter wavelengths (such as UV or blue light) can improve resolution.
3. **Super-resolution techniques:** Techniques like STORM, STED, or SIM use specialized illumination and detection
methods to bypass the diffraction limit and achieve higher resolution.
4. **Image processing:** Advanced image processing algorithms can help improve image clarity by reducing noise and
enhancing contrast.

In summary, the diffraction of light and light wavelength play critical roles in determining the clarity of images
produced by microscopes. By understanding these principles and using techniques to reduce diffraction and increase
resolution, researchers can improve image clarity and gain a deeper understanding of the microscopic world.
