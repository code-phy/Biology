# Cell Growth & Division

## Cell Growth, Division, & Reproduction
    - Limits to cell size
        - The larger the cell becomes the efficient it is in moving nutrients and watse materials across its cell 
membrane.In addition, as a cell grows, it places increasing
          demands on its own dna.
        - surface area to volume ratio is 6:1

    - Cell Division & Reproduction
        - Cell Division
            - The process of making a cell divides into 2 new "daughter" cells.

        - Reproduction
            - Asexual reproduction
                - the production of genetically identical offspring from a single parent.
                - No genetic variation
                    - Vunerable to new diseases
            - Sexual reproduction
                - offspring inherit genes from both parents
                - more genetic variation

## The Process of Cell Division
    - Chromosomes
        - In prokaryotes, DNA is packed in a single circular chromosomes
            - Prokaryotes go throughbinary fission
            - the DNA multiplies and the celll membrane indents itself forming 2 new cells
        - In eukaryotes DNA is packed into multiple chromosomes
            - Eukaryotic cell Division is more complex having specific stages
                - **Interphase**: Cell prepares for division, DNA is replicated in the S phase.
                - **Prophase**:
                    - Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes.
                    - Nuclear envelope begins to break down.
                    - Mitotic spindle fibers form from the centrosomes.
                - **Metaphase**:
                    - Chromosomes align at the cell's equatorial plane (metaphase plate).
                    - Spindle fibers attach to the centromeres of each chromosome.
                - **Anaphase**:
                    - Sister chromatids are pulled apart to opposite poles of the cell by spindle fibers.
                - **Telophase**:
                    - Chromatids reach opposite poles and decondense back into chromatin.
                    - Nuclear envelopes reform around each set of chromosomes.
                - **Cytokinesis**
                    - The cytoplasm divides, resulting in two separate daughter cells with identical genetic 
material.


## Regulating the Cell Cycle
    - At the site of an injury are externallly stimulated to divide rapidly, and as the injury heals it gradually 
slows down to the original pace.

    - Regulatory Proteins
        - As scientist were experimenting with proteins that speed up cell division they found the protein Cyclin
            - Cyclin is one of the regulatory proteins
            - There are 2 types of regulators
                - Internal regulators
                    - responds to events inside the cell
                    - let cell cycle proceed only when certain steps have already happened
                - External regulators
                    - respond to events outside the cell
                    - direct cells to speed up or slow down the cell cycle
                    - growth factors: wound healing and embryonic development

    - Apoptosis
        - The process of programmed cell death
        - Important to the structuring of tissues during growth and development
        - The cell undergoes a series of controlled steps for self destruction

    - Cancer: Uncontrolled cell growth
        - Cancer cells don't respond to normal regulatory signals
        - The cell cycle is disrupted
        - Cells groww and divide uncontrollably
        - after mass production of the cell it starts replacing other cells
        - it results from a defect in genes that control cell growth and division
        - Treatments for cancer
            - Radiaiton to destroy cancer cell DNA
            - Surgery to remove localized tumor
            - Chemotherapy to kill cancer cells or slow their growth

## Cell differentiation
    - Cell differentiation is the process by which a less specialized cell becomes a more specialized cell type, 
gaining specific functions and characteristics.
    - Essential for the development of complex organisms, enabling cells to form tissues, organs, and systems with 
distinct roles (e.g., muscle cells, neurons, blood cells).

    - Stem Cells
        - Differentiation begins from stem cells, which are unspecialized cells that have the potential to become 
various cell types.

    - Gene Expression
        - Differentiation is largely controlled by gene expression, where certain genes are turned on or off, 
dictating the cell’s structure and function.

    - Chemical Signals
        -Differentiation is often guided by signaling molecules (e.g., growth factors) that trigger specific 
developmental pathways.

    - Stages
        -In development, differentiation occurs through a series of stages, with each stage narrowing the cell’s 
potential until it reaches its final, specialized state.

    - Types of Differentiation:
        - Totipotent
            -Cells that can become any cell type, including a whole organism (e.g., zygote).
        - Pluripotent
            -Cells that can become almost any cell type but not a whole organism (e.g., embryonic stem cells).
        - Multipotent
            -Cells with a more limited potential, usually restricted to certain cell lineages (e.g., cells in bone 
marrow).

    - Epigenetics
        - Modifications to DNA and histones (without altering DNA sequence) affect gene expression and play a crucial 
role in differentiation.
        - Muscle cells develop from myoblasts, neurons from neural stem cells, and red blood cells from hematopoietic 
stem cells.
